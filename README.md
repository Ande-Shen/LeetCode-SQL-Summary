## Intro

After finishing all 102 Leetcode SQL questions, I feel the urge to summarize them by knowledge they are trying to test. 

This note aims to **help people _learn and review SQL effeciently_**, espeically when trying to **have a quick catch up on a certin topic**, e.g. complex join, window function, recursive CTE and etc.

And for the first draft, I mainly focus on **_T-SQL/MS SQL Server_**.
